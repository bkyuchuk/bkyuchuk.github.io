<p>If you have been doing some kind of a physical exercise regularly or you follow
    people who have, then leave this page and save your time. As a software developer I'm someone who
    spends 40 hours a week sitting in front of a screen and is totally exhausted aferwards. I have learned my
    lesson the <u>hard way</u>. So the value you can gain from here is:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="my-2">Learn from the experience of a huge sports grouch.</li>
    <li class="my-2">How <strong>not to struggle</strong> both physically and psychically.</li>
    <li class="my-2">How to find time for a workout and form a habit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="display-5">The perfect time will never come.</h3>
<p>I have spent countless hours with thoughts like <i>"I work so much I don't have the energy for sports."</i>
    or <i>"Why not learn or program something instead?"</i>. Of course, time is a valuable currency
    and you want to invest it advisedly. However, you have to realise that doing something for your health
    is by far the best investment you can make in your life. If time is still an issue for you, try out the
    four minute <strong>Tabata</strong> workout in this video.</p>

<p>It's so practical that you can even do it in your appartment and combine it with resistance bands or
    dumbbells.</p>

<h3 class="display-5">Don't be so hard on yourself.</h3>
<p>I'm the kind of person who utterly hates himself when I don't accomplish one of my goals. This could either
    be doing a Udemy course, reading a book, working on a side project or doing sports regularly. 
    <strong>You aren't and will never be perfect</strong>, so the trick is to just start, be patient
    and consistent. You will make <u>massive progress</u> if you workout for less than an hour over a long
    period of time rather than bringing yourself to a complete end on day one.

<h3 class="display-5">Forming a habit is key.</h3>

            <p>During the Christmas holidays I went jogging almost every day despite the weather being cold or rainy.
            The positive effects are immediately noticable. Although I had not done sports before, my breathing,
            body posture and mental sharpness improved in less than two weeks. Only by making such an occupation 
            a habit can you be sure that you will overcome procrastination. In order to achieve this you need 
            determination and a plan. I recommend writing down everything you plan on doing in a 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.de/AmazonBasics-Notizbuch-klassisches-Design-Blanko/dp/B01DN8TB5U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notebook</a>
            which allows to have an overview and structure of your goals. Check out
