        <p>I'm <strong>not</strong> one of the developers who started coding at an early age and loved math. Instead, 
        I invested a great deal of my time in learning foreign languages, especially German and English.
        <br><br>
        In 2019 I graduated
        <a href="https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heilbronn University Of Applied Sciences</a>
        with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. In retrospect, I really enjoyed my four years there, although
        they were sometimes anything but easy. During this time I also completed an internship at a company called
        CAS Software AG. The product that I worked on was a big enterprise web application written entirely in 
        Java EE. I learned how to navigate through a huge codebase, to debug code and to write tests. After graduating from college 
        I moved myself and everything I owned to Munich and joined MaibornWolff where I work as a mobile application developer.

        My first project was a health care app for Android written in Kotlin.
        Neither was my Android knowledge proficient, nor have I had any previous Kotlin experience, so I had to
        pick both up quickly and also learn the app architecture. Nevertheless, in the context of a specific 
        feature I designed it's data models, added the Room persistence library, worked with background task execution
        at a specific time, added notifications. I even implemented a separate module for tracking network
        type and speed as well as a widget showing a gallery of videos and playing them. Overall, it was a success.
        <br><br>
        In mid 2020 I joined BMW's Mobile Connected project where I started learning and working with Dart and Flutter.
        This experience was particularly useful as I gained knowledge of how to communicate in an
        international large scale project. I single handedly implemented a small feature (front- and backend),
        massively shaped not only the i18n of the app, but also made it more accessible by adding
        semantics for screen readers like VoiceOver.
        <br><br>
        Today I plan on working with TypeScript and a couple of other useful web languages and technologies. My story
        is to be continued.
